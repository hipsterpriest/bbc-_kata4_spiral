# bbc-_kata4_spiral
Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order
Example

Input: matrix = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9] ]

Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

**Constraints**

m == matrix.length

n == matrix[i].length

1 <= m, n <= 10

-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100

**Thoughts**

Can you do this in an object-oriented style? 
Or a functional programming one?
Too easy? Can you add a visual representation like the one below?
